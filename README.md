# Perfect Pups

This project is being made as a practice for my overall Front-End skills, heres a brief description of it:


### I will be implementing this API to use some endpoints: 


https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation


### There will be 2 pages in total, Home and Gallery

- **Home:** where the API will be called
- **Gallery:** where the images will appear

This README so far sucks, but will be better *some day hehehe*
